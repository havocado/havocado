### Hello! I'm Hailey. 

I am a recent gruaduate from Simon Fraser University with a degree in Computer Science and Mathematics.

My passion lies in Rendering/Mathematics and I am looking into a career in the field of Computer Graphics.

**Recent interests (last edit: Jan 12, 2024)**

I am spending my time learning rendering techniques before starting on job search.

In the meantime I am building my own raytracer in C++. See repo: https://github.com/havocado/raytracer-by-hailey

I am also writing up some 'what I learned' kind of posts:
- [[PBRT] Understanding the Differential Equation for Absorption Cross Section in Volume Scattering](https://github.com/havocado/notes/blob/main/230913-understanding-absorption-cross-section.md)
- (Still writing!) https://github.com/havocado/notes/blob/2310/ray-triangle-intersection/231018-triangle-collision-raytracing.md

January 2024: I wrote up some problems for MASH 2024 programming contest. See repo: https://github.com/ablondal/MASH_2024

**üñ•Ô∏è Work Experience**

- Sep 2022 ~ Dec 2022: USRA Undergraduate Research - See Projects and Repositories below!

<!--**Repos [üóÑÔ∏è semantic_mapping](https://github.com/havocado/semantic_mapping) [üóÑÔ∏è 3d-reconstruction](https://github.com/havocado/3d-reconstruction)**-->

- May 2021 ~ Dec 2021: Co-op Web Developer

**üèÜ I am proud of:**

- **Achieving 13th place on ICPC Pacific Northwest Regionals 2021**: This makes my team 4th in Vancouver and I am proud of it! ACM-ICPC is the biggest algorithm competition for college students in the world. Also mentioned on SFU website - https://www.sfu.ca/computing/newsandevents/2022/sfu-computing-science-students-win-multiple-awards-at-2021-icpc-.html

- **Top 500 for Putnam Mathematical Competition 2022**: This was the highest score for SFU in 5 years and I got a free A+ for a course in SFU for achieving this! Putnam is competition for undergraduates in mathematics. See website - https://www.sfu.ca/math/undergraduate/current/research-awards-and-competitions/putnam-competition.html

- **Winning 1st place (tie) in Clash of Equations (UBC vs. SFU vs. TRU Math Contest) 2023**: See website - https://www.sfu.ca/math/events-news/news/2023-news/ClashofEquations2023.html

- Other: MASH Programming Contest 2023 (3rd place), A Strange Programming Contest 2022 (3rd place), MSU-UMS (SFU vs. UBC) Math Contest 2022 (3rd place)

**üèòÔ∏è Groups I love**

- **SFU Mathematics Students Union** - Student union for Math ~nerds~ students! A lot of happy memories while working as an exec for MSU during most of my studies in 2019-2023. Website: https://sfumsu.github.io/

- **SFU Competitive Programming Club** - I would say this is one of the best clubs for programmers at SFU! I participated as a problem setter around 2020 when I did a lot of algorithm programming. It is an amazing club that runs weekly practices and introduces students to ICPC/leetcode style programming problems.

- **SFU Artists Club** - A lovely club that gathers every week to make art and ~draw weird things on whiteboard~
