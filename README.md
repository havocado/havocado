### Hello! I'm Hailey. 

I am a student joint majoring Computer Science and Mathematics at Simon Fraser University, and I am expecting to graduate September 2023.

My passion lies in Computer Graphics and I am looking into a career in the field of Rendering/Animations. 

**Recent interests:**

I am currently busy getting over 30 assignments, 10 weekly quizzes and 14 exams including 4 finals in 4 months. (I am regretting it.)

I am planning to code a raytracer when my schoolwork is done.

**üñ•Ô∏è Work Experience**

- Sep 2022 ~ Dec 2022: USRA Undergraduate Research - Repos [üóÑÔ∏è semantic_mapping](https://github.com/havocado/semantic_mapping) [üóÑÔ∏è 3d-reconstruction](https://github.com/havocado/3d-reconstruction)
- May 2021 ~ Dec 2021: Co-op Web Developer

**üèÜ I am proud of:**

- **Achieving 13th place on ICPC Pacific Northwest Regionals 2021**: This makes my team 4th in Vancouver and I am proud of it! ACM-ICPC is the biggest algorithm competition for college students in the world. Also mentioned on SFU website - https://www.sfu.ca/computing/newsandevents/2022/sfu-computing-science-students-win-multiple-awards-at-2021-icpc-.html

- **Top 500 for Putnam Mathematical Competition 2022**: This was the highest score for SFU in 5 years and I got a free A+ for a course in SFU for achieving this! Putnam is competition for undergraduates in mathematics. See website - https://www.sfu.ca/math/undergraduate/current/research-awards-and-competitions/putnam-competition.html

- **Winning 1st place (tie) in Clash of Equations (UBC vs. SFU vs. TRU Math Contest) 2023**: Will be on SFU website soon!

- Other: MASH Programming Contest 2023 (3rd place), A Strange Programming Contest 2022 (3rd place), MSU-UMS (SFU vs. UBC) Math Contest 2022 (3rd place)

**‚ú® Projects and repositories**

- (2022) My research effort that didn't quite work out - [3d-reconstruction](https://github.com/havocado/3d-reconstruction)

- (2022) My research effort that taught me a lot and worked in some degree - [semantic_mapping](https://github.com/havocado/semantic_mapping)

- (2020) An algorithm problem I wrote - https://vjudge.net/contest/578547#problem/A

- (2020) A collection of C++ code for coding problems - https://havocado.github.io/cpp-2020-april

**üèòÔ∏è Groups I love**

- **SFU Mathematics Students Union** - Student union for Math ~nerds~ students! A lot of happy memories while working as an exec for MSU during most of my studies in 2019-2023. Website: https://sfumsu.github.io/

- **SFU Competitive Programming Club** - I would say this is one of the best clubs for programmers at SFU! I participated as a problem setter around 2020 when I did a lot of algorithm programming. It is an amazing club that runs weekly practices and introduces students to ICPC/leetcode style programming problems.

- **SFU Artists Club** - A lovely club that gathers every week to make art and ~draw weird things on whiteboard~
