### Hello! I'm Hailey. 

I am a student majoring Computer Science and Mathematics at Simon Fraser University, and I am expecting to graduate September 2023.

My passion lies in Computer Graphics and I am looking into a career in the field of Rendering/Animations. 

**Recent interests (last edit: Sep 15, 2023)**

I am a Schr√∂dinger's graduate - during the final exam period last month (Aug 2023) I got sick and got some of my exams rescheduled. I didn't get my final grades yet so I'm not officially graduated, but I am done taking courses and waiting for SFU to process my graduation.

In the meantime I am reading PBRT and learning rendering. Take a look at my fancy LaTeX note I wrote while learning Volume Scattering: [[PBRT] Understanding the Differential Equation for Absorption Cross Section in Volume Scattering](https://github.com/havocado/notes/blob/main/230913-understanding-absorption-cross-section.md)

**üñ•Ô∏è Work Experience**

- Sep 2022 ~ Dec 2022: USRA Undergraduate Research - See Projects and Repositories below!

<!--**Repos [üóÑÔ∏è semantic_mapping](https://github.com/havocado/semantic_mapping) [üóÑÔ∏è 3d-reconstruction](https://github.com/havocado/3d-reconstruction)**-->

- May 2021 ~ Dec 2021: Co-op Web Developer

**üèÜ I am proud of:**

- **Achieving 13th place on ICPC Pacific Northwest Regionals 2021**: This makes my team 4th in Vancouver and I am proud of it! ACM-ICPC is the biggest algorithm competition for college students in the world. Also mentioned on SFU website - https://www.sfu.ca/computing/newsandevents/2022/sfu-computing-science-students-win-multiple-awards-at-2021-icpc-.html

- **Top 500 for Putnam Mathematical Competition 2022**: This was the highest score for SFU in 5 years and I got a free A+ for a course in SFU for achieving this! Putnam is competition for undergraduates in mathematics. See website - https://www.sfu.ca/math/undergraduate/current/research-awards-and-competitions/putnam-competition.html

- **Winning 1st place (tie) in Clash of Equations (UBC vs. SFU vs. TRU Math Contest) 2023**: See website - https://www.sfu.ca/math/events-news/news/2023-news/ClashofEquations2023.html

- Other: MASH Programming Contest 2023 (3rd place), A Strange Programming Contest 2022 (3rd place), MSU-UMS (SFU vs. UBC) Math Contest 2022 (3rd place)

  <summary>Surviving thyroid cancer and achieving all above with medication hindering concentration</summary>
  <p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>I don't mention this often because cancer feels like a too heavy topic to bring up in an everyday conversation, so it's normal if you already knew me for a while but never heard about this! üòÜ
  
    <p>I had thyroid cancer several years ago. It's one of the least fatal kind of cancer and I am doing fine (after removing thyroid and going through RAI therapy - it was sure an interesting experience to become radioactive for a week)
  
  I'm currently on TSH suppression, which prevents remaining thyroid cells doing any work, so suppressing the possibility of recurrent cancer. This causes common hyperthyroidism-like symptoms such as:
  - Fatigue (need 9+ hours of sleep everyday)
  - Fast heartbeat
  - Hard to concentrate
  - Sensitivity to cold/heat (the reason I carry an extra clothing everywhere)
  - Weight loss
<br></br>
 
  I am aware that disclosing past cancer can bring some social stigma such as being unable to perform work and being weak (as some studies [[1](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/302972012_The_Big_C-stigma_cancer_and_workplace_discrimination)] [[2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pon.5690)] have shown), so I will assure you that (1) I am expecting to cease TSH suppression within 2~3 years, (2) I maintained a GPA over A- while pursuing a difficult joint major, and (3) healthy enough to do deadlifts.

  Cancer taught me to appreciate my life and follow my passion. In my teenage I often overworked until 1am in the highschool dorm to get good grades and only thought about being successful in the future. Now I make sure I'm not burned out on work, choose the field I enjoy the most (computer graphics!!) and enjoy hobbies (arts!!)
  
  I also have some bad shoulders due to lymph node dissection but I think that's fairly common among programmers.</blockquote>

- (2023) Rendering related stuff:
  - [[PBRT] Understanding the Differential Equation for Absorption Cross Section in Volume Scattering](https://github.com/havocado/notes/blob/main/230913-understanding-absorption-cross-section.md)

- (2022) My research effort that didn't quite work out - [3d-reconstruction](https://github.com/havocado/3d-reconstruction)

- (2022) My research effort that taught me a lot and worked in some degree - [semantic_mapping](https://github.com/havocado/semantic_mapping)

- (2020) An algorithm problem I wrote - https://vjudge.net/contest/578547#problem/A

- (2020) A collection of C++ code for coding problems - https://havocado.github.io/cpp-2020-april

**üèòÔ∏è Groups I love**

- **SFU Mathematics Students Union** - Student union for Math ~nerds~ students! A lot of happy memories while working as an exec for MSU during most of my studies in 2019-2023. Website: https://sfumsu.github.io/

- **SFU Competitive Programming Club** - I would say this is one of the best clubs for programmers at SFU! I participated as a problem setter around 2020 when I did a lot of algorithm programming. It is an amazing club that runs weekly practices and introduces students to ICPC/leetcode style programming problems.

- **SFU Artists Club** - A lovely club that gathers every week to make art and ~draw weird things on whiteboard~
